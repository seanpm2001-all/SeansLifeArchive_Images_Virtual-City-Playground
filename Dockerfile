# I decided to make the project language file for this project (SeansLifeArchive_Images_Virtual-City-Playground) Dockerfile, as I didn't want to overuse Rust as a project language file (despite this being a city game, and my city related projects usually have Rust as the main language) further today, and felt that dockerfile was appropriate, as this city game does have bodies of water, which has a dock.
